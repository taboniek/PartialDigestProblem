# Partial digest problem
Algorithm uses recursion to search map of restriction places. The result is found map or communique about error in multiset. 

### Input file
Input file is multiset containing lengths of fragments coming from digesting a copy of the DNA fragment with one restriction enzyme at various time intervals. This numbers must be seperated by blank space.

Example:
```
7 16 22 30 39 45 9 15 23 32 38 6 14 23 29 8 17 23 9 15 6
```


Results: 
```
4 6 5 8 3 9 5 2 4 7 8 6 6
```
